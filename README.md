## <a id="features"></a>✨ Features

`agy-manager` combines two essential tools for a seamless development experience in the Antigravity ecosystem:

- 🔓 **Location Restriction Bypass:** Disable local availability blockers ("not available in your location") across all three core applications (CLI, Manager, IDE).
- 👥 **Account Profile Manager:** Safely store and quickly switch between multiple authorization profiles offline, without the need for browser-based re-authentication.
- 🎨 **Interactive TUI Dashboard:** Features a beautiful terminal interface built with `rich` and `questionary` for managing both patches and account profiles.
- ⚡ **Zero-Dependency Core:** Scriptable commands run natively using Python's standard library alone, no package installation required.
- 🛡️ **Safe & Reversible:** The patcher requires exactly one original or patched signature inside PE/ELF/Mach-O executable sections, verifies the backup and every write, and rolls back automatically on failure. Original files are kept as `*.agybak`; on macOS, the `.app` signature state is also saved in a sibling `*.app.agysignbak` directory.
- ⚙️ **Smart Autodetect:** Dynamically scans registry keys, system PATH, environment variables, Scoop paths, standard Linux installation prefixes (such as `/opt`, `~/.local/share`, etc.), and macOS `.app` bundles (`/Applications`, `~/Applications`) to automatically locate installations.
- 🧬 **Version- & Arch-Robust Patching:** Locates instruction signatures using regex patterns rather than brittle static file offsets, and carries per-architecture signatures (x86-64 and aarch64) so the same patch works on Intel and ARM builds alike.

## <a id="quick-start"></a>🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository and enter the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QNIX-Dev/eligibility-antigravity-patcher.git
cd eligibility-antigravity-patcher
```

### 2. Choose execution mode

#### Option A: Interactive TUI (Recommended)

Launches the complete terminal dashboard with live status reports for managing both patches and profiles:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Launch agy-manager:**
   ```bash
   python manager.py
   ```

*(Supports arrow-key navigation, spacebar multi-selection, and Enter key confirmations).*

---

#### Option B: Scriptable CLI (No Dependencies)

Runs purely on the Python Standard Library (no installation required). Ideal for automation or direct execution from standard terminals.

| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `python manager.py status` | Scan and display the patch status of all applications. |
| `python manager.py patch` | Patch all detected applications. |
| `python manager.py restore` | Revert all changes and restore original files. |
| `python manager.py patch <cli\|manager\|ide>` | Patch only the specified applications. |
| `python manager.py accounts <cli-manager\|ide> <action> [name1] [name2]` | Manage saved authorization profiles (see details below). |

> [!TIP]
> If your application is installed in a custom directory, you can override automatic detection by passing the path manually:
> ```bash
> python manager.py --path-cli "D:\CustomTools\agy.exe" patch cli
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> **macOS signing runs automatically only while patching on macOS.** The patcher first applies and verifies all selected changes, then ad-hoc signs each modified Mach-O (`agy` and `language_server`) separately, and finally signs the containing `.app` once. Every signature is verified with `codesign`; a failure rolls back the patches and temporary signature changes. When Python lacks extended-attribute APIs, the patcher uses the built-in `/usr/bin/xattr` tool; no extra Python package is needed. After signing succeeds, the patcher automatically removes `com.apple.quarantine` only from the selected applications (recursively for `.app` bundles), preventing Gatekeeper from blocking the locally modified code. During `restore`, the original bundle signature is returned after the last patched target inside that bundle is restored. Keep `*.app.agysignbak` directories for as long as you need the patch and full restoration support.
>
> Removing quarantine does not disable Gatekeeper globally or affect other applications or system settings. The original value of this attribute is not restored by the `restore` command.

---

## <a id="bypass"></a>🔓 Location Restriction Bypass

The patcher neutralizes local eligibility checks and directs each client into its corresponding success path.

> [!NOTE]
> The changes affect client-side decision logic only. This utility **does not** create server-side entitlements, bypass server authentication, or unlock paid features: model and feature availability still depends on server responses.

### Supported Targets

| Target | Application | Patch Vector | Detection Marker |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`cli`** | **Antigravity CLI** (`agy` / `agy.exe`) | Binary-patches `agy` / `agy.exe` to neutralize the local `hasValidAuth` gate and select the `eligible` path. | `agy` / `agy.exe` |
| **`manager`** | **Antigravity Manager** (Electron) | Binary-patches the Go backend `language_server` / `language_server.exe` to neutralize the `hasValidAuth` gate and select the success path. | `resources/bin/language_server` / `resources/bin/language_server.exe` |
| **`ide`** | **Antigravity IDE** (VS Code) | Patches the minified `main.js` to neutralize the local auth gate and select the shortened authentication path. | `resources/app/out/main.js` |

> [!NOTE]
> **Platform Support:** All three patches (`cli`, `manager`, `ide`) are cross-platform and support Windows, Linux, and macOS. The `cli` patch carries separate x64 and arm64 machine-code signatures and automatically selects the one matching the executable architecture. The `manager` patch follows the same model: its x64 signature covers Windows (including Windows-on-ARM, where the x64 backend runs under emulation), Linux x64, and Intel macOS, while its dedicated arm64 signature covers Linux arm64 and Apple Silicon macOS. The `ide` patch modifies JavaScript and therefore uses one architecture-independent signature across all platforms.
>
> On Linux, autodetection scans standard installation prefixes (such as `/opt`, `/usr/share`, `/usr/lib`, `~/.local/share`, `~/.local/bin`, and the launcher directories of `antigravity` and `antigravity-ide` in `PATH`). On macOS, it scans `.app` bundles under `/Applications` and `~/Applications` (the binaries live inside `Contents/Resources/`); after patching, signatures are refreshed from the inside out and the shared bundle is signed only after all selected targets. For non-standard locations, specify the executable paths manually via command line options (e.g., `--path-cli`). Ensure the applications are closed before patching to prevent file locking issues. Account management (`accounts`) remains Windows-only for now.

## <a id="accounts"></a>👥 Account Profile Manager

Saves the current active Antigravity session under a unique profile name, allowing you to switch between profiles offline without invoking the browser.

### Management Scopes
Sessions are isolated into two independent scopes:
1. **CLI + Manager** (share a common credential stored in Windows Credential Manager).
2. **IDE** (uses its own authorization keys in the SQLite database `state.vscdb` inside VS Code).

This separation avoids database locking conflicts and lets you switch accounts for different tools independently.

### Usage in the Interactive Menu:
1. Choose **Manage accounts** in the main menu of `python manager.py`.
2. Select the target scope: **CLI + Manager** or **IDE**.
3. Use the menu options to save the current session, switch to a saved profile, delete profiles, or log out locally.

### Usage via the Command Line:
Command structure: `python manager.py accounts <cli-manager|ide> <action> [name]`

| Action | Example Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `list` (or `ls`) | `python manager.py accounts cli-manager list` | List saved profiles for the chosen scope and mark the active one. |
| `save <name>` | `python manager.py accounts cli-manager save work` | Save the current active session under the specified name. |
| `use <name>` (or `switch`) | `python manager.py accounts cli-manager use personal` | Switch to a saved profile. |
| `logout` | `python manager.py accounts cli-manager logout` | Sign out locally (allowing you to sign into another account). |
| `rename <old> <new>` (or `mv`) | `python manager.py accounts cli-manager rename work personal` | Rename a saved profile. |
| `rm <name>` | `python manager.py accounts cli-manager rm work` | Remove a saved profile. |
| `current` (or `who`) | `python manager.py accounts cli-manager current` | Print the name of the current active profile. |

## <a id="details"></a>🔍 How it Works (Technical Details)

<details>
<summary>🛠️ <b>CLI Patch (`agy.exe` Go Binary)</b></summary>

At startup, the CLI reads the `hasValidAuth` field (the byte at offset `+8`) of the AuthResult returned by the server. The result selects either the `eligible` path or the local "Eligibility Check" screen.

1. **x64 builds:** The patcher scans for the unique gate signature: `test rax,rax` → `je` (eligible) → `cmp byte ptr [rax+8],0` → `jne` (eligible) → `call failure_builder` → spills of `rax`, `rbx`, and `rcx` to `[rsp+0x80]`, `[rsp+0x50]`, and `[rsp+0x70]`. Additional supported x64 layouts from newer builds spill `rax`, `rbx`, and `rcx` to `[rsp+0x88]`, `[rsp+0x50]`, `[rsp+0x78]` (1.2.5–1.2.6) and `[rsp+0x88]`, `[rsp+0x50]`, `[rsp+0x70]` (1.2.7+); separate signatures constrain those exact instructions.
2. Without the patch, a zero `hasValidAuth` execution falls through and prints the error. The patch rewrites `cmp byte ptr [rax+8],0` to `test rax,rax` (+`NOP`): since `rax` is non-null here, the `jne` jump always selects the “eligible” branch.
3. The local gate consequently selects the `eligible` path during both initial login and subsequent CLI runs; the server response and global product configuration remain unchanged.
4. **arm64 builds** (Windows, Linux, and macOS) contain the outer check: `cbnz x1,error` → `cbz x0,eligible` → `ldrb w1,[x0,#8]` → `tbnz w1,#0,eligible` → `bl failure_builder` → spills of `x0`, `x1`, and `x2` to `[sp,#0x90]`, `[sp,#0x60]`, and `[sp,#0x80]`. An additional supported ARM64 layout, observed in a macOS build, spills `x0`/`x1`/`x2`/`x3` to `[sp,#0x98]`/`[sp,#0x60]`/`[sp,#0x88]`/`[sp,#0x58]`; a separate signature constrains those exact instructions. The patch replaces the flag load with `mov w1,#1`, so the existing `tbnz` always selects the eligible branch. The `MultiGate` class automatically selects the x64 or arm64 signature. CLI 1.2.7 on macOS ARM64 uses `w2` for the flag and spills `x0`/`x1`/`x2`/`x3` to `[sp,#0x90]`/`[sp,#0x58]`/`[sp,#0x78]`/`[sp,#0x50]`; a separate signature replaces the load with `mov w2,#1` and preserves the existing eligible branch.

<details>
<summary>📦 <b>Manager Patch (`language_server.exe` Go Backend)</b></summary>

The Electron Manager communicates with a local Go backend `language_server.exe` via connect-rpc. The `hasValidAuth` verdict (the byte at offset `+8` of the AuthResult) is decided in a single root location — the `authclient.(*PersonalAuthValidator).Validate` function.

1. **x64 builds:** The patcher finds the validator's unique gate signature: `cmp byte ptr [rax+8],0` → `je` (skips the success path) → the subsequent instructions in that path.
2. The check and jump are overwritten with `mov byte ptr [rax+8],1` + `NOP`: the flag is forced to `true` and the conditional jump is removed, so execution continues along the success path.
3. This validator's result is returned by `GetAuthStatus` and used by the login routine, so both locations receive the same forced-success verdict during initial login and subsequent restarts.
4. **arm64 builds** (Linux arm64 and Apple Silicon macOS) contain the same gate in AArch64 code: `ldrb w3,[x0,#8]` → `tbz w3,#0,skip` → one or two context instructions → `stp x3,x4,[x0,#0x60]`. The patch rewrites `ldrb;tbz` into `mov w3,#1 ; strb w3,[x0,#8]`, forcing the flag to `true`, removing the conditional jump, and continuing along the success path. The `MultiGate` class automatically selects the x64 or arm64 signature.
</details>

<details>
<summary>💻 <b>IDE Patch (`main.js` VS Code Hack)</b></summary>

1. The script parses the minified entrypoint `resources/app/out/main.js` using regular expressions.
2. It looks for the minified auth branch pattern: `resetIsTierGCPTos\(\),this\.[A-Za-z_\$0-9]+\.isGoogleInternal`.
3. Replaces it with `resetIsTierGCPTos(),true`, so only this check always selects the shortened internal authentication path; the global `isGoogleInternal` setting remains disabled.
4. Clears VS Code's system bytecode caches (`CachedData` and `Code Cache/js`) to apply modifications instantly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>👥 <b>Account Profile Manager (Offline Session Swapping)</b></summary>

Profile switching is fully offline and does not call standard logout endpoints (which would revoke tokens on the server).

1. **Storage Separation:** CLI/Manager tokens reside in Windows Credential Manager under `gemini:antigravity`. IDE tokens are read from the VS Code global SQLite DB `state.vscdb` (under `antigravityUnifiedStateSync.*` keys).
2. **Secure Persistence:** On `save`, active credentials are read, encoded, and saved back to Windows Credential Manager under unique prefixed names: `agy-manager:account:cli-manager:<name>` or `agy-manager:account:ide:<name>`.
3. **Blob Size Limit Bypass:** generic credentials in Credential Manager are limited to 2560 bytes, but the IDE's JSON state can exceed 8 KB. IDE profiles are automatically sharded into 2000-byte pieces and stored as indexed entries (`.../<index>`).
4. **Syncing and Lock Prevention:** Before writing a new profile, the active session is automatically synced to preserve any rotated session keys.

## <a id="warnings"></a>⚠️ Caveats & Warnings

- **Version Compatibility:** The patcher is only guaranteed to work on the **latest** versions of the applications. It relies on binary signatures tied to specific builds, so on older versions it may fail to locate the required instructions and simply do nothing — the status will show as `unknown` and no file is modified (a safe no-op). Update the app to the latest version if this happens.
- **Updates Overwrite Patches:** Updating any of the applications will overwrite the modified binaries. Re-apply the changes by running `python manager.py patch` again.
- **File Locks & Running Processes:** Make sure all target applications in the corresponding scope (CLI, Manager, or IDE) are completely closed before patching or switching profiles. Otherwise, the OS will block file writes, or the active process may overwrite the restored database credentials from its in-memory cache.
- **Token Security:** All your credentials and profiles remain completely local to your machine. They are stored inside the secure Windows Credential Manager and your local SQLite database, and are never shared with external services.
- **Terms of Service:** Modifying proprietary client-side binaries might violate the applications' Terms of Service (ToS). This project is intended solely for educational purposes—use it at your own risk.
